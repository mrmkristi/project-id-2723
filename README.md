Static HTML & CSS website based on a Figma design.
Challenge - no Javascript
Icons - Font Awesome

1. Made header adjust width according to screen size.
2. Made table and customers list scrollable, since the table does not look visually great on smaller screens when the columns are pressed together.
3. Indeterminate checkbox is made using a label and Font Awesome, since indeterminate does not exist without Javascript.
